              As a child I was primarily interested in horses, not something
              you would expect someone technology interested to write? Well,
              this interest turned me to a website for horse-interested girls.
              On this website one could design their profile using html, which
              is where I pinpoint that my interest for development started.

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary text--white">Teenage years</h3>
            <p class="about-text">
              In my teens I swapped out horse riding lessons for kickboxing,
              but I was still interested in digital art. I began to move on to
              other sites like deviantArt. Later I chose to study Media and
              Communication and ICT-Service, and continue with vocational
              education afterwards. I spent 2 years as an intern at the
              Norwegian Coastal Administration.

              After finishing my internship with the Norwegian Coastal Guard I
              found out I was pregnant. My plans took a completely different
              direction. After spending over a year at home I knew I wanted to
              do something else. I applied for Computer Science at NTNU. I
              spent my summer doing a precourse calculus, while looking after
              my toddler (not an easy task, as one can imagine).
