                Hello there! My name is Janita Lillevik Røyseth, I was born 1998
                and come from Ålesund in Norway. For most of my life I've been
                interested in technology, digital art and design. As a result I
                am now currently attending my 2nd year at NTNU. I expect to be
                finished with my bachelors degree in June 2023.
              </p>

              <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Childhood</h3>
              <p class="about-text">
                As a child I was primarily interested in horses, not something
                you would expect someone technology interested to write? Well,
                this interest turned me to a website for horse-interested girls.
                On this website one could design their profile using html, which
                is where I pinpoint that my interest for development started.
              </p>
              <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Teenage years</h3>
              <p class="about-text">
                In my teens I swapped out horse riding lessons for kickboxing,
                but I was still active on the previously mentioned site,
                designing and drawing. But I also moved on to other sites like
                deviantArt. I later chose to study Media and Communication and
                ICT-Service, and continue with vocational education afterwards.
                I spent 2 years as an intern at the Norwegian Coastal
                Administration.
              </p>
              <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Adult life</h3>
              <p class="about-text">
                After finishing my internship with the Norwegian Coastal Guard I
                found out I was pregnant. My plans took a completely different
                direction. After spending over a year at home I knew I wanted to
                do something else. So I applied for Computer Science at NTNU. I
                spent my summer doing a precourse calculus, while looking after
                my toddler (not an easy task, as one can imagine).
              </p>

                I am currently studying the 2nd year of Computer Science at NTNU
                Ålesund, which focuses on application development. It is always
                interesting and challenging, and also a lot of fun. It has been
                a very rewarding road so far.

              As a part of vocational education I was an intern at the Norwegian
              Coastal Administration. During my internship I worked primarily in
              the support center, but did other tasks such as installing images
              on new pc's, assisting with backup procedure, attending linux
              course and more.

              During my second year in high school I chose to switch over from

              visited IntraHouse in Ålesund once a week for a period of time,
              getting a soft introduction to the workday of a tech company.

              For my first year in high school I chose to do vocational studies

              strengths and weaknesses on the subject.

            </h3>
            <p>
              In systemdevelopment we had a semesterassignment where we were
              tasked with creating a todo-list for a specific group. Our group
              chose to make one for home care, to keep track of daily tasks,
              list of patients and more. We organized a test group of nurses of
              various ages and genders, and improved our system based on their
              feedback. We used gitlab to work together on the project.

              Because of corona, instead of one school exam we were given 3
              projects over the semester in programming 2. First project we were
              given was to make a hospital system where we used inheritance by
              using interface and abstract classes. Second and third project
              were very similar in that we were tasked to make GUI for a
              patientregistry, and later postal codes in norway.

              Corona. For this exam we were tasked with creating a system, with
              no GUI, over daily registered corona infections and deaths.
